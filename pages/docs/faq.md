Final Thoughts:
From Blood and Ash is a poorly written book that had good intentions, but was overall a dissapointment. The author put no effort into a functioning storyline, but spent too much effort on making sure the *sexual activity* parts are extremely detailed. I would not recommend this book to anyone, but the most diehard romance nerds. 



Explanation of the review points:



*If I paid any money for this book, I would be flipping mad.

**The average time is around 10 pages, and the longest acceptable is 50 pages. At 10-50 pages, you should be able to introduce the characters, and start on the storyline. This book completely ignores it, and starts with random, Uninteresting things that barely hook the reader. 

*** Mature themes are very prominent in this book, around 5% of the book is centered around the mature theme. Characters will engage in sexual activity with very little relation to the plot. The author relies heavily on sexual activitys as a way to develop charecters without acctually devleoping the charecers. 

**** This book uses a plot twist in the end in order to increase interest, the author uses what I like to call a “Point blank plot twist” (Which means that the plot twist comes out of nowhere with no signaling) A point blank plot twist is okay to use, and is not a problem, but is not as good as something with little foreshadowing. This plot twist lacks the part where it makes you think back and go “ Ohhhh, I should have seen the signs”. 

***** The Different fractions in this book are poorly explained, and skimmed over. It felt like the author wanted you to take a stance like the main character, you are hidden from the truth. The main problem is that even when the author had the chance, it was still poorly explained. 

****** Normally, Books either fall into two categories, either they have a whole series, and the ending is vague in order for you to read the next book, that is what I call “ The sellout”. The well ending, just as the name states, is that the book is ended off well, and all the loose ends are tied. The book had a half-baked attempt in order to try and intrigue you into the next book, and did not end it off well.
