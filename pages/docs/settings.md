-There were too many “erotica” moments in the book****
-Some husbands actions felt like they were shoehorned in to support a cause 


Overall review:

This is a great long book, and something that you will love. It's not something that I would recommend to small children, as it contains many mature themes that they may not be ready for. 





Notes:
*  - Most books try to have an LGBT theme so that they can be hip with the youth, or show people that “they care” about the LGBT community. Normally, this is either badly done, where a gay person is thrown in without proper linking to the storyline, or where the entire book is about LGBT, where its just not interesting. Refer to this document, I Dont Care About your Sexuality  Where it talks about how LGBT is overdone. 

** - Monique had her own storyline, but was not well written, and her only reason to be there is to push the story along. This book felt like it was written as a 2nd perspective of Evelyn’s life at first, but then the author did not know how to tie in some parts, so he added in Monique in order to end the story. 

*** - In some parts, the references and talk about sex is added in well, and it shows that Evelyn will do to get what she wants. It helps move the story along in a way that makes some sense, and builds into the character that Evelyn has. 

**** - Sometimes, the author will just throw in a part where someone does something sexual for no reason. Sometimes it is good, and it moves the plot along. Sometimes, it does not fit into the plot forward, and just adds too much sexual refences into the book. Each time making it less comfortable to read. 

***** - The husbands overall were very good, and they felt like they fit into the book.
