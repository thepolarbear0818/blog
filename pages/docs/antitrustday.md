# Anti-trust Day Blog (22-4-4)

Today is antitrust day, where we campaign to make it so that the online world can be used.

If you did not know what antitrust day was, this day is a day to make it so that congress does not suck on their thumbs all day when it comes to regulating big companies, or asking big CEO’s on how to use google.(This happened when during an antitrust lawsuit a judge asked the CEO of google and facebook on what his daughter does on their platforms and how he can see it.)

“We need Congress to pass legislation that will give internet users more choices for the products and services we use. Dominant tech companies abuse their gatekeeper status to undermine human rights, distort democracy, abuse our personal data, and stifle competition. As a constituent concerned about these issues, I’m writing to ask you to support antitrust reform legislation that will create fair rules for the road and protect our basic rights.”

This is like the bottom of the barrel things, why is it that when I purchase an item, that I truly do not own it? 

Right now, if you try to install an app on your iphone that is not allowed by apple (Which the review process seems like it's a mix of monkeys on cocaine choosing and people pressing random buttons.) Nothing happens, you cannot install a custom app on your iPhone without some weird workaround that gets broken every 2 weeks because the apple engineers choose to “fix” it.

One of the biggest movements of this movement is to allow custom app stores that are not a monopoly.  Let's put it down to the lowest terms so tech illiterate people can understand.

>Monkey see banana
>Monke gets banana from tree
>Tree says no peeling skin
>monke no get
>Why no peel skin?
>Tree say so you no get food poisoning

>monkey ignores, peels skin
>tree remotely turns banana into mush
>bans monke for eternity

This may seem like I was on drugs while I wrote this, but it's what happened recently. A games producer called Epic put “fortnight” on apple’s app store, but implemented their own way of paying, since everything that goes through apple, apple takes a 30% cut. Epic did this so that they can keep prices the same on all platforms, and not charge extra to compensate for the extra cut. 

But apple did not like this, since the 3 month olds on fortnite just can't stop spending money for V-Bucks, and if you choose the apple store method, you had to pay more. So of course, they went for the cheaper option that allowed them to spend less on the V-Bucks. This made apple take a loss. So they removed fardnite from the app store. Since there are so many apple users, Epic lost a significant amount of money since about half of their revenue was gone.

You can see the connections between the monke story and what happened in real life. Monkey gets banana from tree, because he needs it to survive. After getting banana, the tree, or here apple, imposes an arbitrary limit, and if you break that rule, then you get kicked out.

But why should you support this movement? Well, how would you like it, if whenever you bought something on your Iphone, or android that you were getting a fair price, and that if you did not like how one vendor charged, you can change to another vendor.

Let's say that you were buying bananas from target, for this scenario, let's say that target charges merchants 5$ to put it in target. To account for this , the merchants charge 5$ more. So because that target charged extra, you will have to pay that price as well.

In the Apple ecosystem, This Target store is the only place where you can get things. They will not let you do anything outside of that target. 

But what if another store charged no extra fee, which means you save 5$ over target. WEll, you can't go to that store because Apple said so. 

You are missing out on what could be more products, or cheaper prices for the illusion of security.



While I have a long rant feeling inside of me, why not go for more, it's like a read one get one free.


Why do I hate the government and Corporations so much?


After reading my writing, you may have noticed that I have a strong hate for the government and many big corporations. But the question that you may be asking is why do I hate them so much? 

Well, it's not because I'm trying to be a quirky teen, but it's to show how much people in this country are missing the point. 

Back all the way when people used muskets and yelled:” tally ho!” THe government was a trustable place, people wanted to work for them, it was an honorable job and people trusted what the government said, because all the best people are there. 

But over time, people realized that they could get more money by doing different things. This leads to a loss of people who are passionate about working for the government, and there is less incentive for people to choose a long and grueling desk job over something that may pay more and have more benefits.

Have you noticed that the average of our presidents have gone up recently? Well, that is because there are less young people that want to work for the government. It's not an appealing job, since all the rules and regulations if you want to be honorary, and even if you cheat and break the rules, there isn't much money to be made, even if you are nancy pelosi(but most of her work to make money is in the stock market anyways).

It costs so much to go to law school, and the climb from getting out of law school and becoming an actual government official, compared to going for a computer science major and learning python or something and landing a job at a startup. 

Even kids like me can just go on the internet and learn, but for law school, there is so much to remember, and everything is so expensive. To learn something like programming, all you have to have is a computer and internet, and the last is even debate-able. 



But how do we solve this problem? 

Well, the two main problems that I see is that the government is not appealing to young people, and the second problem is that you can't make enough money in the government, compared to something like trading crypto and stocks. And the third problem is the filtering of information. 


The solution for the first problem is easy, It's just like how you get people interested. Growing up, there were so many hours of code classes, and so many coding opportunities available, and nothing taught us about law. Schools should offer something similar to coding, like laws, and make it so that more and more people are interested in a job in the government. 

The solution for the second problem is just taxing the big companies more and spreading it out to the government people, this reduces the incentive to have a side job, or do something sketchy. 

The solution to the third problem is twofold. First, the government must provide researchers with proper labs and things, and be able to release information without the government censoring it and cherry picking. This way, the US citizens can get information, and regain trust in the government that they are putting money in the right places, instead of rolling some plants into a bill and smoking it.

The second part is more on the citizens, the people have to be able to get this information free of charge.

Most “unbiased” News outlets like the NYT are under paywalls, and drive users away. This leads to users swaying towards more biased outlets, which are free to get their news. 

THe US government needs to create a news outlet that is

1: Unbiased 
2: Free of charge, Both as no paid fee and that you are not the product.

Combining good research, and a good way to deliver information to citizens without a middleman to change anything is the best way to put the country back on track, where everyone believes in science and technology, with more trust in the government, and with more people cycling through the government so that there are more ideas, and less people sitting on their butts and doing nothing.
