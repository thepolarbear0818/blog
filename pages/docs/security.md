# I Don't Care about your sexuality

I really donâ€™t care about your sexualaity.

Please shut up about it.

Recently with the rise of LGBTIA, the amount of people flaunting their gender or
sexuality is insane.

No, I dont care if you are trans or gay or whatever, I cant care less. I like
people for who they are, and not because they are a certain gender. The only
time that I would care is if we were in a relationship, and I still can't care
less if you are bi or straight or whatever.

Please stop flaunting it around. You can be gay or dreamsexual or whatever, but
if the only thing about your personality is based on is your sexuality, please
get off of twitter and touch some grass.
