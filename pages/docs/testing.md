# The legend of Mrs.Mcflurry (Video Script Archive)

Mrs.Mcflurry was an odd one, have you ever just had this one substitute teacher that was just either really strict, or lax? 

Well Mrs.Mcflurry simultaneously sits on that line, and is reporting that line to the police for sexual harassment. 

You might be wondering, where did the name of Mrs.Mcflurry come from?


It starts all the way in PE class, or as some of you know it as, Gym. Our gym teacher was gone,so the school had called in a sub. Normally the Gym in our school isn't really chaotic, and any half-decent teacher can handle it. (except for one PE teacher who got caught watching porn supposedly, but that's another story for another time. )

Whenever we get a sub in PE, we usually just play tag or some other game in the gym, and that's a perfectly normal way to pass 85 minutes. But this time was something else. We got Mrs.Mcflurry as a sub.

Mrs.Mcflurry’s real name isn't actually Mrs.Mcflurry, as some of you might have guessed. When she got to the school, she “swaggered” to the gym (that's actually how she walks and I'm not making that up). Then she told everyone to shut up, and took attendance. After taking attendance, she opened up a clipboard that our PE teacher left for her to read, and then slowly read to us the rules of tag. Then she walked away, sat on the bleachers and read a book. 

Nothing special here, it was only in the middle of the class when we noticed that our teacher wasn't here. 

And here is where the name is born. One of my friends, who I'll call down badly, said: “ Wait! Our teacher is gone!”.

After looking at the bleachers, all traces of our sub was gone. Which then I made the comment : “ She looks like she left to get a mcflurry” 
“And a 6 piece of chicken nuggets” Someone shouted out. 

Another person tried to say: “Wait, where did Mrs. …… Wait what's her name again?”

Nobody remembered what her name was, so we just called her Mrs.Mcflurry And from there, a new name was born. 

After a while, Mrs.Mcflurry comes back with a different book, and thermos in her hand. Probably filled with a Mcflurry.

All while this was happening, the Tag game continued on. Someone tagged a girl, who we will call girl a, and that girl tagged someone a little too hard. We will call this girl, girl b.Girl B got tagged screamed, and then Mrs.Mcflurry swagger over to that girl, and asked who tagged her.

Girl B pointed at Girl A, and Said: “her” 

Then Mrs.Mcflurry swaggered over to Girl A, and then pinched her ear, while screaming: “ DON'T DO IT AGAIN”.

Girl A Cried, and then ran to the principal's office.

A PA came over the speakers to call Mrs.Mcflurry to the office, and she slowly swaggered over to her cup, and brought it to the office. 

After a while, Girl A came back, and Mrs.Mcflurry didn't. A few minutes later the principal came, and brought out the basketballs, and told us to do whatever for the last few minutes of class. 

We thought that that was the end of Mrs.Mcflurry, but there's a reason why she is a legend. 

2 Semesters later, she came back.

This time it was in a different class. Our teacher had an emergency, and so they called in a sub. 

Apparently, our school district was lacking substitute teachers, so they had to call in people who were not exactly: “the best” 

The moment we came in, I was the only one who was shocked. Nobody else knew the legend of Mrs.Mcflurry.

This time, she told everyone to shut up, and started with class. This class was right after finals, so our teacher planned something easy, we played board games for a class (so that we could design them).

While we were playing board games, we popped out some playing cards that were in this cardstock. A friend and I noticed that they kinda looked like brass knuckles, so we punched the table with them as a joke. 

Mrs.Mcflurry heard this, and swaggered over to our table. She said: “ Nuh uh uh, give me those” While shaking her finger.  Then she gave us a 20 minute lecture on fighting and gangs and something. Then she walked away, and did not take them away. 

Then she returned to sitting on the chair, and doing nothing.

Then two boys did a fist bump, because they won the game, and of course, Mrs.Mcflurry swaggered over to them and said: “Nuh uh uh, you boys shouldn't be doing gang signs in school. You belong at the police station” I overheard that randomly, and I had a hard time getting it, until one of the boys told me the context, which was a fist bump.

After that, class ended, and the worst part was that I stayed in the same classroom for Homeroom, so I had to be in another class with Mrs.Mcflurry. 

A few minutes later, one of my friends put his backpack down, and talked to me. Then he threw the paper airplane in his backpack so that he wouldn't lose it.  Mrs.Mcflurry swaggered over to my friend's backpack, and fished the plane out, and stood right in front of him, and ripped it up. All with the expression that she smelled something stinky on her face. 

Then She said: “ Nuh uh uh, You know better” And then yelled at him and me to sit down. 

The worst part is, in her sub notes, she said that my friend was throwing paper airplanes all over the classroom, and throwing it at people, even though we had multiple witnesses. 

Before the period ended, she promptly disappeared, and never came back. 

Probably to get a McFlurry.

That is the end of the Legend of Mrs.Mcflurry. I hope you enjoyed it.
